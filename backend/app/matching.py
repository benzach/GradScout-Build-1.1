"""
Matching logic: does a given job satisfy a user's saved search criteria?

Worth noting how this differs from the dedup engine (app/dedup/): that
was deliberately pure, DB-independent Python because it was the riskiest,
most novel piece of the whole system and needed to be testable in total
isolation. This module is simpler, well-understood business logic
(keyword/location/salary filtering — the same shape of logic the
original prototype's core/filters.py already proved out), so it's fine
for it to operate directly on SQLAlchemy objects rather than maintaining
that same strict separation. Not every module needs the same rigor —
matching the level of caution to the level of actual risk/novelty.

Matching semantics (see conversation for the product-decision framing):
  - keywords: ANY match (OR), checked against title + description
  - locations: ANY match (OR), checked against job.location_category —
    EXACT membership, not substring matching. Every job's location gets
    reduced to exactly one of a finite set of canonical categories at
    storage time (see app/locations.py's categorize_location(), called
    from app/storage.py), and criteria.locations is expected to contain
    values from that same finite set — this is what makes a genuine
    dropdown-style location filter meaningful rather than the earlier
    free-text substring approach, which couldn't guarantee the options
    shown to a user actually corresponded to real, matchable job data.
  - contract_types: ANY match (OR), checked against the job's contract_type tags
  - industries: ANY match (OR), checked against job.industry_category —
    same exact-membership design as locations, mirroring
    app/industries.py's categorize_industry()
  - salary_min: job's salary must meet the threshold IF it has a parsed
    salary at all — jobs with no parseable salary are KEPT, not excluded,
    since missing data shouldn't count against a job (same philosophy as
    the prototype's filter engine)
  - sources_enabled: if set, only jobs from one of those specific sites
    match; if None (the default), all sources are eligible
