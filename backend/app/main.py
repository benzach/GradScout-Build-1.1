GradScout API. Run locally with:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Then visit http://localhost:8000/docs for the interactive API
documentation — FastAPI builds this automatically from the code, it's
not something maintained separately.

Auth is self-hosted (app/auth.py, app/security.py): POST /auth/signup
creates an account and POST /auth/login authenticates one, both
returning a bearer token this API issues and verifies itself — no
external identity provider, no second platform account needed just to
authenticate someone.
