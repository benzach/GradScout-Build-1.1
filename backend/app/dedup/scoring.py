"""
Stage 3 of the dedup pipeline: fuzzy scoring.

Takes two ALREADY-NORMALIZED jobs (see normalize.py) that blocking (see
blocking.py) has decided are worth comparing, and produces a confidence
score for whether they're the same underlying job posting.

Uses rapidfuzz for text similarity rather than TF-IDF + cosine similarity.
Both answer the same question ("how alike are these two texts?") — the
choice here is about the frontier of compare-two-strings vs
compare-against-a-corpus: rapidfuzz needs no fitting step and is very
fast for pairwise comparison, which is what we're doing here (one new
job against a handful of blocked candidates, not searching a whole
corpus). If very long descriptions become the norm, TF-IDF cosine
similarity is worth revisiting.

Salary and date are treated as CONFIRMING signals, not gating ones —
they nudge the final confidence up or down rather than being required
to match, since salary is very often missing entirely from one source
or the other, and repost dates can genuinely differ by a day or two for
what's actually the same listing.
