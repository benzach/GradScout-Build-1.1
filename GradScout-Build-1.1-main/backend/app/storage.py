"""
Storage layer — where the dedup engine (Phase 0, pure Python, no DB
knowledge) meets real persistence.

This module does two dedup checks, in order, and it's worth understanding
why there are two rather than one:

1. EXACT check (cheap): has this exact URL from this exact site been
   scraped before? A unique constraint on job_sources(site, source_url)
   makes this a single indexed lookup. Every re-scrape of a posting we
   already know about gets caught HERE, for almost no cost — this matters
   because a scheduler polling every 15-30 minutes will re-fetch mostly
   the same jobs over and over; without this check, every single one of
   them would run through the expensive fuzzy engine every single cycle.

2. FUZZY check (only for genuinely new URLs): is this a new posting for
   a job we've already seen from a DIFFERENT source? This is Phase 0's
   dedup engine, unchanged — normalize -> block -> score -> decide.

On the fuzzy check's candidate pool: rather than re-implementing the
blocking company-match logic in SQL, we fetch a coarse pool from the
database (jobs posted within the last 30 days — a plain indexed range
query) and hand it to the ALREADY-TESTED Python blocking/scoring logic
from Phase 0 unchanged. This preserves exact fidelity with everything we
validated in Phase 0's test suite, at the cost of fetching a wider pool
than strictly necessary. At real scale (many thousands of jobs/day) the
known next optimization is adding a Postgres trigram index (pg_trgm
extension) so the company-fuzzy-match narrowing happens in SQL too — not
needed yet, and deliberately deferred rather than built speculatively.
